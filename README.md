# Queens-Gambit-Blendor-Project

### ``Scenerio meaning``

How Beth actually beats Borgov has to do with a series of surprising moves, following her Queen’s Gambit opening.

It’s worth noting that the Queen’s Gambit opening—where White trades its pawn to control the center of the board—highlights many of the series’ themes. Ultimately, the gambit is a sacrifice, a hedge. It requires one to give up something early in order to win. Characters including Harry, Jolene, and Mrs. Harmon all sacrifice something for Beth, who, in turn, makes several sacrifices throughout the series. (In the final scene, Beth’s White jacket and hat form the shape of a pawn—the piece which is sacrificed.) The most significant trade: her drug abuse.
