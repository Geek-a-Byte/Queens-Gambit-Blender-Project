### ``Scenerio meaning``

<p>

How Beth actually beats Borgov has to do with a series of surprising moves, following her Queen’s Gambit opening.


It’s worth noting that the Queen’s Gambit opening—where White trades its pawn to control the center of the board—highlights many of the series’ themes. Ultimately, the gambit is a sacrifice, a hedge. It requires one to give up something early in order to win. Characters including Harry, Jolene, and Mrs. Harmon all sacrifice something for Beth, who, in turn, makes several sacrifices throughout the series. (In the final scene, Beth’s White jacket and hat form the shape of a pawn—the piece which is sacrificed.) The most significant trade: her drug abuse. As the game progresses, Beth appears to be holding her own. Then on, Borgov proposes an adjournment, which requires him to write his next move on a piece of paper and seal it within an envelope. The next session is kicked off with the prepared move, ensuring that neither player has an advantage.

The reason why Borgov requests an adjournment could simply be chalked up to a long game and fatigue, as hinted by an interview tape in which he says, “I can fight against anyone but time.” An adjournment is also an opportunity to reevaluate one’s strategy and approach the game with a fresh perspective, which makes sense from a practical standpoint. During this time, Beth comes to the realization that she is, in fact, not alone in her endeavors, as everyone around her, including Townes, Benny, and Harry, along with others, help her control her substance abuse and work round-the-clock to find weaknesses in Borgov’s game. The next day, Beth is finally able to access a mental chessboard without the aid of sedatives, an indication that she has finally overcome the obstacles that limit her as a chess player, and as a person. While Borgov offers a draw, as losing is not an option for him, Beth refuses, as a draw is not an option either. Having envisioned a winning strategy in 19 moves, Beth beats Borgov, winning the tournament.
